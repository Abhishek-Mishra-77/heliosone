  # Add Resiliency Analysis Function

  1. New Function
    - Creates a stored procedure to calculate resiliency analysis metrics
    - Aggregates data from assessments, responses, and related tables
    - Returns comprehensive analysis including:
      - Category scores
      - Response metrics
      - Compliance metrics
      - Risk metrics
      - Readiness metrics

  2. Security
    - Function accessible to authenticated users
    - Checks organization access permissions
